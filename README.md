Implementation of GAN for images. 
For demo, we are using mnist hand written dataset images as dataset. The images are used to train adversarial netowork that comprises of two networks, 
the generator and the discriminator. The generator network generates images from the random data while the discriminator classifies an image as fale or real. 
At the end of the adversarial  training, the generator is trained to generate close to real images.
